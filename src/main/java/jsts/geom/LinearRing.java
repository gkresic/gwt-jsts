 * Models an OGC SFS LinearRing. A LinearRing is a LineString which is both
 * closed and simple. In other words, the first and last coordinate in the ring
 * must be equal, and the interior of the ring must not self-intersect. Either
 * orientation of the ring is allowed.
 * 
 * A ring must have either 0 or 4 or more points. The first and last points must
 * be equal (in 2D). If these conditions are not met, the constructors throw an
 * IllegalArgumentException
